Dresden International School Computer Science Wiki
==================================================

In this repo, the code that powers the wiki of Dresden International School's computer science course is stored. The last wiki created by the course from the grade above us became obsolete because the IBO changed the syllabus. We wanted to use this chance and decided to turn away from the mediawiki and to create fully customisable solution instead. Finally, we decided to go with Jekyll.

It is important to note that it will only contain the code for the logic and not the actual documentation entries itself. Those are stored in Google drive, synced with the server using the Google Drive command line client and then included into the _pages directory of Jekyll which will then recognise the change and build the site automatically.

**We really hope that our wiki will be as help- and successful as the last one. Enjoy!**
